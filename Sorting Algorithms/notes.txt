- Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format : either ascending or descending.

- Types of sorting algorithms:
    - Space used:
        - In place: Sorting algorithms which does not require any extra space for sorting e.g Bubble sort
        - Out of place: Sorting algorithms which requires an extra space for sorting e.g Merge sort

    - Stability:
        - Stable: If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents does not change the sequence of similar content, then this sorting is called stable sorting 
            e.g insertion sort. pg616
        - Unstable: If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents changes the sequence of similar content, then this sorting is called stable sorting 
            e.g quick sort.

- Sorting terminologies:
    - Increasing Order: If successive element is greater than the previous one e.g: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ,11
    - Decreasing Order: If successive element is less than the previous one e.g 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1
    - Non Increasing Order: If successive element is less than or equal to its previous element in the sequence e.g 11, 9, 7, 5, 5, 3, 1
    - Non Decreasing Order: If successive element is greater than or equal to its previous element in the sequence e.g 1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 9, 11


- Sorting algorithms:
    - Bubble sort: We repeatedly compare each pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
    - Selection sort:  we repeatedly find the minimum element and move it to the sorted part of array to make unsorted part sorted.
    - Insertion sort: similar so selection sort except that, we pick the first element of the unsorted array and place it in its right position in the sorted array.
    - Bucket sort:
        - Create buckets and distribute elements of array into buckets
            - Number of buckets = round(Sqrt(number of elements))
            - Appropriate bucket = ceil(value * number of buckets / max_value)
        - Sort buckets individually
        - Merge buckets after sorting
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort
    - Heap sort

    - The one selected is based on:
        - Stability
        - Space efficiency
        - Time efficiency
